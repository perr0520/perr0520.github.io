        <h2>About Me</h2>
            <P>My name is Ben Perron, I am from a small town about two hours north of Toronoto called Waubaushene. It has a population of roughly ten thousand. I have lived there my entire life until the start of this school year where I moved to Quebec in and apartment in Gatineau.</P>
            <p>My whole life i found that I felt out of place where I lived. Due to the fact that everyone where I lived were hunters, fisherman, and country folk. I do not have a problem with that except I thought of myself as a more city person which is why I moved so far away.
