        <h2>About Me</h2>
            <P>My name is Ben Perron, I am from a small town about two hours north of <em>Toronoto</em> called <em>Waubaushene</em>. It has a population of roughly 10,000. I have lived there my entire life until the start of this school year where I moved to Quebec in an apartment in Gatineau. As a kid i was homeschooled by my parents but mainly my mom, who was a stay at home mom while my dad (a paramedic) went to work and provided for the family. Homeschooling was benificial because when my parents wanted to take my siblings and I out for an extracurricular activity such as skiing, hiking, and travelling they didnt need to worry about us missing school because in advance we would do all the work that needed to be done so we could go out. I have 3 siblings, an older brother (zach) an older sister (alex) and a younger sister (elizabeth). We were all homeschooled up until highschool because my mother said that homeschooling us through highschool would be to much work for her and my dad.</P>
            <p>My whole life i found that I felt out of place where I lived. Due to the fact that everyone where I lived were hunters, fisherman, and country folk. I do not have a problem with that except I thought of myself as a more city person which is why I moved so far away. Since I started playing video games at a young age I always dreamed of being able to go into a career in technology. After highscool I was unsure where I wanted to take my life due to a lack of motivation and being afraid of leaving home on my own. In this period of time I met my girlfrfriend. She changed me life enourmously and gave me motivation to not only want to move out but to start my adult life by going to school and thinking about the future. Once I made the decision to go to school I was looking at courses at <em>Algonquin College</em> and saw <em>Interactive Media Design</em> and insatnly made it my 1<sup>st</sup> pick. When I saw that i was excepted I was super excited and ready to learn about desinging all kinds of things such as websites using <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> language. I am now very excited for the future and happy that I made the decision to move forward with my life and career.
            One quote that I learned in school and liked is <blockquote>"Where there is love there is life." -<cite>Gandhi</cite></blockquote>
