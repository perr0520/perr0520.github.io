    <h1>Ben Perron</h1>

        <h2>About Me</h2>
            <P>My name is Ben Perron, I am from a small town about two hours north of Toronoto called <em>Waubaushene</em>. It has a population of roughly 10,000. I have lived there my entire life until the start of this school year where I moved to Quebec in and apartment in Gatineau.</P>
            <p>My whole life i found that I felt out of place where I lived. Due to the fact that everyone where I lived were hunters, fisherman, and country folk. I do not have a problem with that except I thought of myself as a more city person which is why I moved so far away.</p>
            <p>Since I started playing video games at a young age I always dreamed of being able to go into a career in technology. After highscool I was unsure where I wanted to take my life due to a lak of motivation and being afraid of leaving home on my own. In this period of time i met my girlfrfriend. She changed me life enourmously and gave me motivation to not only want to move out but to start my adult life by going to school and thinking about the future. Once I made the decision to go to school I was looking at courses at <em>Algonquin College</em></p>
